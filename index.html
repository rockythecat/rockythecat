    <h5>About Rocky</h5>

    <p>Rocky is a male domestic short hair, neutered.  He has
    implanted the HomeAgain chip, ID number 985 112 002 159 998.
    (That's 985112002159998 or 985-112-002-159-998, for those
    searching for other forms of the number.)  He is a gray tabby,
    with white chest, underbelly and feet, and a white "collar" around
    his neck.  We try to keep a real collar on him but he often loses
    it.</p>

    <p>He was probably born sometime around 2012.</p>

    <p>Rocky is quite social with people, talks a lot (for a cat), and
    gets along well with dogs.</p>

    <p>Please return him if you find him!</p>

    <h5>About the shameless HomeAgain corporation</h5>
    
    <p>The HomeAgain corporation wants to charge an annual fee to keep
      your pet's chip ID on file and searchable.  This is ridiculous.
      The amount of their recurring fee is re<em>donk</em>ulous.
      HomeAgain can stuff it.</p>

    <p>Worse, we weren't told about the annual fee until after the
      chip was inserted!</p>

    <p>We're not paying.  Hence, this web page.  It's now possible to
    search the Internet for Rocky's HomeAgain Id.</p>
